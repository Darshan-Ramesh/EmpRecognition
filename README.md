# EmpRecognition
A project in collaboration with the Radboud University to recognise ancient portraits of Roman Emperors. 
1. For Face detection, we have used a MTCNN pretrained model and saved the images as 256x256.
2. We have finetuned a pretrained InceptionResnet model for facial recognition task.
